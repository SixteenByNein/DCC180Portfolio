            <p>I am an artist from Eastern Washington living in Utah. I have a broad range of artistic disciplines including video production and post-production, 3D modeling and animation, web development, and 2D illustration.</p>

            <p>Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to be a filmmaker. I've always loved learning new skills and I was drawn to the creativity and problem-solving involved in the field and have always loved making things that are interesting or beautiful.</p>

            <p>This love of learning has led me to pick up many skills such as 3D modeling and computer programming. My creative upbringing by two very artistic parents has made thinking creatively into my default state of being for me as I'm always asking myself questions like "how can I make this more interesting?" This upbringing also means that I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil (any homework assignment I turned in was probably 40% doodles).</p>

            <p>I currently work as an English as a Second Language teacher which has taught me how to communicate ideas simply and clearly as well as how to listen to the needs of others, two skills that have also helped me as I have become a more professional artist.</p>
